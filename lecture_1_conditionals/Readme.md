<h2>📌 Lecture: CS50P - Lecture 1 (conditionals)</h2>
<h2>💡 Project: BMI calculator with category </h2>
<hr/>

<h2>📜 Description</h2>
<p>This project calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) using their weight and height. It categorizes the BMI using conditional logic into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.</p>

<h2>🎓 Concepts Applied</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conditionals (<code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>else</code>)</li>
  <li>Functions and return values</li>
  <li>User input</li>
  <li>Float conversions</li>
  <li>Error handling using <code>try-except</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>📁 Folder Structure</h2>

<h2>💡 How This Fits into My AI Engineer Roadmap</h2>
<p>Understanding how to apply decision-making logic with conditionals is crucial for building intelligent systems and data-based models. This foundational logic is used later in model evaluation, decision trees, and AI rule engines.</p>

<h2>✅ Sample Output</h2>
<pre>
BMI Calculator
Enter your weight in kg: 70
Enter your height in meters: 1.75

Your BMI is 22.86. You are categorized as: Normal weight
